Each space was curated to provide comfort, functionality, and spatial hygiene.",

The atrium wall carries a bespoke vertical feature design that draws the eye upward, creating a sense of openness and elevation.

      "Suvakholi Mountain Resort is a boutique retreat nestled in the pristine hills of Naldi, Suvakholi — a region known for its panoramic views and untouched natural beauty. Designed as a harmonious blend of modernity and nature, this resort comprises a thoughtful mix of three distinct prefabricated architectural typologies: capsule cottages, an A-shaped house, and larger modular homes. All units are designed using insulated steel and prefab wall systems, ensuring quick construction, thermal efficiency, and minimal ecological impact",
      "The concept was inspired by the philosophy of minimal footprint and maximal experience. Each structure is strategically placed along the contoured landscape to enhance the visitor’s connection with the vast open surroundings. The capsule cottages, often associated with compact, efficient, and modular living (inspired by Japanese and Nordic typologies), are tailored for solo travelers or couples seeking a cozy yet immersive stay. The A-frame structure, a highlight of the property, anchors the hill with a striking geometric silhouette — doubling as a gathering lounge and view deck for guests",
      "The project was an architectural exercise in restraint and environmental sensitivity. From retaining natural slopes to preserving existing trees and topography, the entire masterplan celebrates nature as its primary canvas. We designed the entire experience — from landscape zoning and pedestrian paths to the warm, minimalist interiors of the restaurant and cottages. Every detail was curated to create a retreat that not only shelters but uplifts the spirit of those who stay, while respecting the delicate terrain of Suvakholi.",

      "This 3BHK apartment, nestled in Broadleaf Apartments, was envisioned as a contemporary and comforting home for the Kanaujia family. The living room features a neutral base palette with clean-lined furniture, accented by wooden louvers, marble cladding, and warm ambient lighting. The design focuses on seamless functionality, seen in the floating TV console, layered ceiling, and minimal trims that create a visually open and balanced space. The dining area extends the same language, with a sleek marble dining table, high-back cushioned chairs, and a custom-designed crockery unit that integrates open and closed storage. A puja niche at the end of the corridor acts as a subtle spiritual anchor to the space. The kitchen carries a warm wooden tone with integrated appliances, concealed handles, and under-cabinet lighting, keeping the area sleek, practical, and spacious. Glass partitions allow light to travel through while maintaining spatial definition",
      "The bedrooms reflect a distinct identity while maintaining a cohesive material language. The master bedroom features a plush fabric headboard panel that runs wall-to-wall, paired with clean wall mouldings and warm bedside lighting. The father’s bedroom is designed with symmetry and simplicity in mind—highlighted by a geometric wardrobe, a full-height mirror, and a floating dresser that maximizes floor space. Subtle color blocking and textural layering make the rooms feel grounded yet fresh. The apartment opens up to two spacious balconies—each designed as a relaxing retreat with rattan furniture, metal planters, and concealed storage units. Together, these outdoor spaces frame panoramic views of the surrounding Dehradun landscape, tying in nature with the home’s calming interior vibe. ",

      "This 3BHK apartment, nestled in the quiet pockets of Broad Leaf Apartments, Dehradun, was conceptualised and executed with a vision to create a modern, warm, and functionally elegant home. The layout features a spacious master bedroom, two additional bedrooms including a vibrant and imaginative kids’ room, a tranquil living lounge, and an open kitchen–dining zone that unifies the social heart of the home. The material palette brings in soft pastels, textured neutrals, blonde wood, and subtle greens to reflect the surrounding hills while maintaining a luxurious city-home tone. Intelligent storage systems and concealed units were used extensively to maximise space utility while maintaining visual calmness throughout.",
      "Each space was designed as a character zone — from the serene minimalism of the master bedroom with its ribbed panels and parquet flooring to the playful, colour-rich kids’ room that sparks curiosity and warmth. The dining and bar areas are treated with curved wooden elements, jute cane screens, and soft lighting to make the space feel airy and grounded. The overall interior styling balances organic materials with crisp design details, offering a home that is timeless, personal, and layered with both comfort and aesthetic distinction.",

Every room carries a distinct elegance—ranging from the delicate floral wallpaper backdrops in the bedrooms to the gentle curves and muted palette in the dining and lounge spaces. The seamless integration of subtle design features like recessed lighting, curated artwork, and wooden paneling helps in creating a warm and sophisticated sanctuary that doesn’t overpower but embraces its residents",
      "The bathrooms carry a spa-like sensibility with soft beige tiles, a floating vanity, and clean fixtures, while the kitchen stands out with its matte olive cabinets and white countertop finishes, balanced with sleek hardware and under-counter lighting for a fresh, clutter-free cooking space. Each corner of this home reflects a thoughtful spatial philosophy—crafted to feel inviting, minimal, and timeless. The overall aesthetic maintains restraint, yet resonates with character and depth, making this residence a beautiful reflection of comfort- driven luxury.",

      "DeepLok Residence is a sophisticated residential villa nestled in the serene backdrop of Dehradun, where the interiors were envisioned to harmonize clean architectural lines with warm, homely aesthetics. Our design response focused on enhancing spatial flow across public and private areas, blending function with elegance. Neutral tones are used throughout the villa with an interplay of wood textures, tactile fabrics, and soft lighting that creates a deeply comfortable and luxurious setting. The living and dining areas are designed to foster openness and interaction, centered around contemporary furniture and marble feature walls that reflect understated opulence.",
      "The bedrooms exude a calm, restful aura with thoughtfully integrated wardrobes, layered lighting, and wall treatments that echo the larger visual narrative. A bespoke entertainment wall with textural contrast becomes the heart of the master suite, while other bedrooms maintain individuality through artwork, material palettes, and custom detailing. From layout planning to furniture placement, every design choice reflects a quiet sophistication suited to modern family life in the hills",

Each space in the home — from the living area to the bedrooms — carries a sense of openness and thoughtful material layering. We introduced natural textures through rattan, wood grains, linen upholstery, and cane shutters, tying everything together with a palette of warm neutrals and leafy greens. The living room features a custom L-shaped couch, wooden ceiling panelling, and a handmade chandelier that frames the space with character.",
      "The bedrooms carry individual personalities through curated details — handcrafted wall art, exposed wooden shelving, patterned tiles, and soft lighting accents. Bathrooms were designed with a mix of bold patterns and calm textures, combining glazed tiles with warm wood finishes and rattan lights for a handcrafted, resort- style touch. A compact yet functional servant quarter was also integrated, maintaining privacy and utility without compromising the apartment’s seamless flow.",
